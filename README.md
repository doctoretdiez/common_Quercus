# common_Quercus
these R files use csv files downloaded from the FIA mart and data pulled from the GBIF database. 
After manipulating the data, we were able to map the occurences of two common oak species, Quercus alba and Quercus rubra, using the GBIF data
and the density of surveyed plots using the FIA data. These files walk us through the entire process.

The working directory is currently set up for my personal computer, but that can easily change.
I will upload the necessary data files for the FIA data to the ULMUS server, but I am still figuring out how to upload them.
