# common_Quercus
these R files use csv files downloaded from the FIA mart and data pulled from the GBIF database. 
After manipulating the data, we were able to map the occurences of two common oak species, Quercus alba and Quercus rubra, using the GBIF data
and the density of surveyed plots using the FIA data. Secondly, we found the climatic variables for the occurrence points of each species and used them to make niche maps for each species. These files walk us through the entire process.

The working directory is currently set up for my personal computer, but that can easily change.
The necessary data files for the FIA and PRISM data can be found on the ULMUS server: /home/data/FIA_DATA; /home/data/PRISM
